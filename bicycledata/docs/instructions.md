## Garmin Varia radar

The radar is placed on the rear of the logger. It registers vehicles
approaching from behind, logging their distance and relative speed from
a range of about 140 m.

Garmin Varia 716. To switch on/off, press the large button for 2 s.
Charge the unit with a USB-C cable (included).


## Button

The button is placed on the handlebars and attached to the logger via
USB-C. You mark overtakes (and possibly also oncoming traffic, see
instructions below) by pressing the button.

## Accessories

- USB-C-cable for charging

- USB-C- or micro-USB-cable to charge the Garmin Varia (depends on the
  model you get)

- A few re-usable zip ties to secure the logger to the seat rails

- A few pieces of soft material to put between the holder clamp and the
  seat rails

# How do I mount the equipment?

1.	Mount the clamp to the saddle rails using an Allen key. It is advisable to place the soft material underneath to avoid scratching the rails. It may take a little creativity to get a good placement, for example some saddles are designed such that it works better to mount the clamp upside down.
2.	Mount the logger to the clamp (tighten firmly). Test to make sure the logger does not interfere with your pedalling. If so, move it one hole back.
3.	Secure the logger with a zip tie or similar so that the rear end does not drop onto the wheel due to possible vibrations or shocks.
4.	Attach the push button to the handlebar using the Velcro. Choose a location that is easy to reach, but where you will not accidentally press the button. You may want to try a few different locations.
5.	Route the cable from the button along the frame to the logger. Make sure the cable does not get in your way and that you can turn the handlebars freely. You can secure the cable with tape or a zip tie.
6.	Connect the cable to the logger using the USB connector.
7.	Attach the Garmin Varia radar to the holder on the back of the logger.

# How do I operate the equipment?

It is important that you turn the equipment on and off in **the described order** so that all sensors can find each other and the data upload will work. The order is also stated on the sticker on the logger.

## Start

1. Activate your hotspot (`bicycledata`).
2. Start the Garmin Varia (press the big button on the side for 2 seconds) – the LED on the side will turn green, then red. [Can be different for different devices.]
3. Start the logger with the ON/OFF-switch. It takes a minute or two for the logger to start. You can see the battery status of the logger on the display. The display turns off after a while.
  a. **WiFi**: The WF-led indicates that the logger has connected to your hotspot and can download updates or new configurations.
  b. **WiFi**: When the WF-led turns off, you can shut off your hotspot if you want.
  c. **Radar**: The RA-led indicates that the logger has connected to the Garmin Varia.
  d. **GPS**: The GP-led indicates that the logger has got a GPS fix. This can take a while, 4-7 minutes is not unusual.

## Data upload and shutting down
1. Activate your hotspot again (`bicycledata`).
2. Press the data button for 5 seconds (until the LEDs start flashing).
  a. All three LEDS are flashing (data is being uploaded).
  b. Wait until all LEDs have turned off.
3. Turn off the Garmin Varia by pressing the button for 2 seconds. All LEDs on the Garmin should be off.
4. Turn off the logger with the ON/OFF/Charge-switch. You can see the current charging level on the display for a few seconds. If you do not set the switch to OFF, the battery will drain.


# How do I charge the equipment?

## Logger
One charge lasts for around 8-9 hours of riding.
Charge the logger via a USB-C-cable. 
The ON/OFF-switch must be set to OFF. 
You see the charging level on the display when you attach and detach the cable. 

## Garmin Varia
One charge lasts for approximately 6 hours.
Charge the Garmin Varia with the enclosed cable.
While charging, a LED flashes green. When fully charged, the LED remains on.


# My data

You go to the homepage and log in here: https://bicycledata.vti.se/ 

## After each ride

OBS: This will be updated with additional functionality

Log in on your dashboard after each ride to:
• mark whether the data originate from a real ride or if you only tested the logger and ”played” with it (in this case click “hide”)
• mark whether you rode on your own (write “0”) or in the company of others (indicate how many people you rode with)
• (optional: note the battery status of the logger in the beginning and in the end of the ride—this is for future development of the logger)
• comment certain events or other things we should know about the ride (note anything you find relevant, regardless of whether it is about overtaking events, traffic situations, the weather, comments about the logger and handling; we will develop the dashboard further over time, let us know what you would like to see). 

# How do I access my data?

## What happens when I’m done with the data collection? 

Also after returning the logger, you’ll be able to log in, see and download your data as long as the server is running and we have the possibility to maintain it. We cannot give any guarantees about the timeframe, however. 

## Download data

You can download both the raw data and processed events (observe, currently only raw data are available). Below is a brief description of what this means. For more information, see the detailed description (information to come).

Each sensor generates a file that contains data from your entire ride (raw data). This information forms the basis of our analyses. In addition, there is a data file containing the overtake events found in the material. For each event it contains the location, the lateral distance, the vehicle speed when overtaking and other information. If you also marked oncoming vehicles, you will find an additional file for those passes, but they do not contain vehicle speed.

## Who can access my data?

Only you, via your dashboard, and the researchers at VTI who participate in the project can access your raw data. The processed events can be published on openly accessible maps and in other publications and will be shared with other researchers within the [ComCy](https://www.vti.se/en/archives/projects/ComCy)-project.
