## Garmin Varia radar

The radar is placed on the rear of the logger. It registers vehicles
approaching from behind, logging their distance and relative speed from
a range of about 140 m.

Garmin Varia 716. To switch on/off, press the large button for 2 s. 
Charge the unit with a USB-C cable (included).


## Button

The button is placed on the handlebars and attached to the logger via
USB-C. You mark overtakes (and possibly also oncoming traffic, see
instructions below) by pressing the button.
