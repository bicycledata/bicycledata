## TrafficLogger

A logging device measuring the lateral distance to passing traffic. The
device contains:

- Raspberry Pi as core unit

- A Lidar-sensor measuring lateral distance to passing vehicles (and
  everything else on your left side, up to around 10 m)

- GPS-sensor logging your position and speed

## Garmin Varia radar

The radar is placed on the rear of the logger. It registers vehicles
approaching from behind, logging their distance and relative speed from
a range of about 140 m.

Garmin Varia 716. To switch on/off, press the large button for 2 s.
Charge the unit with a USB-C cable (included).


## Button

The button is placed on the handlebars and attached to the logger via
USB-C. You mark overtakes (and possibly also oncoming traffic, see
instructions below) by pressing the button.

## Accessories

- USB-C-cable for charging

- USB-C- or micro-USB-cable to charge the Garmin Varia (depends on the
  model you get)

- A few re-usable zip ties to secure the logger to the seat rails

- A few pieces of soft material to put between the holder clamp and the
  seat rails

# How do I mount the equipment?

1.	Mount the clamp to the saddle rails using an Allen key. It is advisable to place the soft material underneath to avoid scratching the rails. It may take a little creativity to get a good placement, for example some saddles are designed such that it works better to mount the clamp upside down.
2.	Mount the logger to the clamp (tighten firmly). Test to make sure the logger does not interfere with your pedalling. If so, move it one hole back.
3.	Secure the logger with a zip tie or similar so that the rear end does not drop onto the wheel due to possible vibrations or shocks.
4.	Attach the push button to the handlebar using the Velcro. Choose a location that is easy to reach, but where you will not accidentally press the button. You may want to try a few different locations.
5.	Route the cable from the button along the frame to the logger. Make sure the cable does not get in your way and that you can turn the handlebars freely. You can secure the cable with tape or a zip tie.
6.	Connect the cable to the logger using the USB connector.
7.	Attach the Garmin Varia radar to the holder on the back of the logger.
