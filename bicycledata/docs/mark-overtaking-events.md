# Marking of events
To ensure that the data material is as good as possible, we ask that you familiarise yourself with the procedure. We will regularly review the data material that you upload and provide feedback. You are welcome to contact us at any time at <bicycledata@vti.se>

## On which rides should I log data?

Use the logger on your regular rides, preferably on asphalt roads in mixed traffic. The vibrations on gravel roads can be tough on the equipment. It is fine to take shorter stretches of gravel roads.

## For which vehicle types should I mark overtakes?

All motor vehicles that require a driver’s licence (including trucks, tractors, motorbikes) except mopeds.

## In which situations should I mark overtakes?

Mark overtakes only if you are riding in mixed traffic, that is in the lane, on a shoulder or in a cycle lane that is not physically separated. A painted line or milled rumble strips do not count as physical separation.  
Do not mark any overtakes if you are in a separate cycle lane, behind a guardrail, or otherwise separated from motor traffic. See the table below for examples.

Of course, your safety always comes first. You decide when you feel safe to mark overtaking. Don't feel pressured to press the button when it feels unsafe, for whatever reason.

## When and how should I mark overtakes?

You ride as usual, except that you use the push button to mark when you have been overtaken. The idea is that you press the button soon after the vehicle has passed you – as a guideline, the earliest when you can see the license plate. This helps us to reliably find the overtakes in the data material (see also _link to be inserted_). Only press the button if it feels safe and secure in the situation.

      <strong>Car parallel</strong><br>
      The car is behind or next to you. Wait for the overtake to be completed before you press the button.
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="/static/images/road_environments/OvertakeFront.jpg" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;" alt="Car has just overtaken cyclist"><br>
      <strong>Overtake completed</strong><br>
      The car has passed you. You can see the licence plate. Press the button now.
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="/static/images/road_environments/OvertakeFar.jpg" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;" alt="Car has passed and proceeded"><br>
      <strong>Car far ahead</strong><br>
      Press the button no later than here (depending on your and the vehicle's speed).
    </td>
  </tr>

    <td align="center">
      <img src="/static/images/road_environments/OvertakeVeryFar.jpg" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;" alt="Car has passed and is very far ahead"><br>
      <strong>Car very far ahead</strong><br>
      Do not wait this long before pressing the button.

      <strong>Press button in gaps between vehicles</strong><br>
      Several cars in a row overtake you. If possible, press the button in the gaps between them. Try to end the previous press before the next car starts to pass you.
    </td>
  </tr>

## Bonus – marking of oncoming traffic

If you want, you can mark both overtaking and oncoming traffic. This gives us additional information, but it is also more complex for you as a cyclist to keep track of. So – better good markings of only overtakes than half-bad markings of both overtaking and oncoming traffic.

If you want to mark both: Make the button presses for overtakes long, about a second.

Make the button presses for oncoming traffic short, just a “click” (0.1-0.2 seconds). Mark oncoming traffic when it is physically in about the same place as where you are marking overtaking vehicles. This means that oncoming traffic is still in front of you when you press the button.

The button press should ideally be completed before the vehicle passes you. Note on your dashboard whether you pressed the button for overtaking only or also for oncoming vehicles.

A rule of thumb to remember: The vehicle is always in front of you when you press the button. Overtaking vehicles take longer to pass you --> long button press; oncoming vehicles pass in a shorter time --> short button press.

      <strong>Long button press</strong><br>
      Press the button for around 1-2 s when you see the licence plate of the overtaking vehicle.
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="/static/images/road_environments/OncomingFront.jpg" style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%;" alt="Oncoming car"><br>
      <strong>Short button press</strong><br>
      Press the button briefly (0.1-0.2 s) when you still can see the front of the oncoming vehicle.
    </td>
  </tr>

## Riding with others

If you are cycling with others, make sure not to press the button when another cyclist is on your left, as the distance to the cyclist will then be measured. If you are to the left of others, you can press the button as above. You indicate on your dashboard whether you were cycling alone or with others.
