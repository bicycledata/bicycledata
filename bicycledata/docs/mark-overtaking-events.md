# Marking of overtaking (and oncoming) events
To ensure that the data material is as good as possible, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the procedure. We will regularly review the data material that you upload and provide feedback. You are welcome to contact us at any time at bicycledata@vti.se

# On which rides should I log data?

Use the logger on your regular rides, preferably on asphalt roads in mixed traffic. The vibrations on gravel roads can be tough on the equipment. It is fine to take shorter stretches of gravel roads.

# For which vehicle types should I mark overtakes?

All motor vehicles that require a driver’s licence (including trucks, tractors, motorbikes) except mopeds.

# In which situations should I mark overtakes?

Mark overtakes only if you are riding in mixed traffic, that is in the lane, on a shoulder or in a cycle lane that is not physically separated. A painted line or milled rumble strips do not count as physical separation.
Do not mark any overtakes if you are in a separate cycle lane, behind a guardrail, or otherwise separated from motor traffic. See Table 1 for examples.

Of course, your safety always comes first. You decide when you feel safe to mark overtaking. Don't feel pressured to press the button when it feels unsafe, for whatever reason.

# When and how should I mark the overtakes?

You ride as usual, except that you use the push button to mark when you have been overtaken. The idea is that you press the button soon after the vehicle has passed you – as a guideline, the earliest when you can see the license plate. This helps us to reliably find the overtakes in the data material (see also _link to be inserted_). Only press the button if it feels safe and secure in the situation.

# Bonus – marking of oncoming traffic

If you want, you can mark both overtaking and oncoming traffic. This gives us additional information, but it is also more complex for you as a cyclist to keep track of. So – better good markings of only overtakes than half-bad markings of both overtaking and oncoming traffic.

If you want to mark both: Make the button presses for overtakes long, about a second.

Make the button presses for oncoming traffic short, just a “click” (0.1-0.2 seconds). Mark oncoming traffic when it is physically in about the same place as where you are marking overtaking vehicles. This means that oncoming traffic is still in front of you when you press the button.

The button press should ideally be completed before the vehicle passes you. Note on your dashboard whether you pressed the button for overtaking only or also for oncoming vehicles.

A rule of thumb to remember: The vehicle is always in front of you when you press the button. Overtaking vehicles take longer to pass you --> long button press; oncoming vehicles pass in a shorter time --> short button press.
