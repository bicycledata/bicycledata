# Marking of overtaking (and oncoming) events
To ensure that the data material is as good as possible, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the procedure. We will regularly review the data material that you upload and provide feedback. You are welcome to contact us at any time at bicycledata@vti.se

# On which rides should I log data?

Use the logger on your regular rides, preferably on asphalt roads in mixed traffic. The vibrations on gravel roads can be tough on the equipment. It is fine to take shorter stretches of gravel roads.

# For which vehicle types should I mark overtakes?

All motor vehicles that require a driver’s licence (including trucks, tractors, motorbikes) except mopeds.

# In which situations should I mark overtakes?

Mark overtakes only if you are riding in mixed traffic, that is in the lane, on a shoulder or in a cycle lane that is not physically separated. A painted line or milled rumble strips do not count as physical separation.
Do not mark any overtakes if you are in a separate cycle lane, behind a guardrail, or otherwise separated from motor traffic. See Table 1 for examples.
